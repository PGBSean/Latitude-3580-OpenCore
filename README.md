## The config.plist includes:
- Mapped USB and Camera (Camera is not suitable for people who has darker skin tone)
- SecureBootControl is set to MacBookPro 15,1 and ApECID for enhanced security (You do not to enable Secure Boot in the BIOS)
- Proper HDMI support and display calibration
- and more...

## Set up
To install macOS, you need a OS version at least macOS 11 (Big Sur) or above, this includes macOS Monterey, Ventura, and above (Beta versions not guaranteed), and a proper Internet connection for SecureBootControl and ApECID for personlized volumes.

Before you go ahead and install macOS, make sure that:
- BitLocker is **suspended** or **turned off** in Windows (if needed)
- Turn off **Secure Boot**, **Fastboot**, **TPM**, and **Auto OS Recovery** Threshold in BIOS
- If you have Windows installed, it's **reccommended** that you **wipe** the drive through BIOS or on your own.
- If your **Ethernet port** is **damaged** or not available, use your Android phone instead.

## iServices
**DO NOT LOG IN TO YOUR APPLE ID ON FIRST SETUP**, because the serial number isn't vaild anymore! Update on your own by using GenSMBIOS (https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
